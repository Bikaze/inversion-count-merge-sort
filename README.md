# Inversion Count using Merge Sort

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the merge sort algorithm with an added feature to count the number of inversions in an array. Inversions in an array occur when elements are not in sorted order.

## How to Use

1. **Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.**

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bikaze/inversion-count-merge-sort.git
3. **Ensure that the integer_list.txt file contains a list of integers, each on a new line. The one provided contains 100,000 numbers!**

## Acknowledgments
- The merge sort algorithm used in this implementation is a classic sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability.
- Inspired by the need to count inversions efficiently, the algorithm piggybacks on the merge sort process.
<br><br>**Feel free to contribute and improve this implementation!**
## Reference

This implementation is inspired by the algorithms course on Coursera by Stanford Professor Tim Roughgarden. You can find the course [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms).
